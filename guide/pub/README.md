# Pub Package Manager

You can use the pub tool to manage Dart packages. Pub is one of the tools that you get when you install the Dart SDK.

:::warning
The Flutter SDK has its own commands for managing and updating packages. For more information, see [Using Packages](https://flutter.io/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages) on the [Flutter website](https://flutter.io/).
:::

You can access the pub commands either through an IDE, such as WebStorm, or at the command line. Use whatever approach is most convenient.

## Managing packages
Dart applications rely on packages. If your Dart app uses one or more library packages, then your app itself must be an application package.
:::tip
Pub used to support building apps through commands like pub build and pub serve. That functionality is now in other tools such as the build system. For details, see [Obsolete Pub Features](./obsolete.md).
