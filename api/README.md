Welcome to the Dart API reference documentation, covering the core Dart API libraries. Some of the most fundamental Dart libraries include:

- [dart:core](/api/core/core/): Core functionality such as strings, numbers, collections, errors, dates, and URIs.
- [dart:html](/api/web/html/): DOM manipulation for web apps (available only to web apps).
- [dart:io](/api/vm/io/): I/O for non-web apps.

Except for `dart:core`, you must import a library before you can use it. Here's an example of importing `dart:async` and `dart:math`:

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:math';
```
You can install more libraries using the pub package manager.
