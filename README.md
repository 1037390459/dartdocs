## Dart helps you craft beautiful, high-quality experiences across all screens, with:

- A client-optimized language
- Rich, powerful frameworks
- Delightful, flexible tooling

# Why Dart?

Developers at Google and elsewhere use Dart to create high-quality, mission-critical apps for iOS, Android, and the web. With features aimed at client-side development, Dart is a great fit for both mobile and web apps.

Dart is free and open source, developed on GitHub.

## Productive

Dart’s syntax is clear and concise, its tooling simple yet powerful. Sound typing helps you to identify subtle errors early. Dart has battle-hardened core libraries and an ecosystem of thousands of packages.

## Fast

Dart provides optimizing ahead-of-time compilation to get predictably high performance and fast startup across mobile devices and the web.

## Portable

Dart compiles to ARM and x86 code, so that Dart mobile apps can run natively on iOS, Android, and beyond. For web apps, Dart transpiles to JavaScript.

## Approachable

Dart is familiar to many existing developers, thanks to its unsurprising object orientation and syntax. If you already know C++, C#, or Java, you can be productive with Dart in just a few days.

## Reactive
Dart is well-suited to reactive programming, with support for managing short-lived objects—such as UI widgets—through Dart’s fast object allocation and generational garbage collector. Dart supports asynchronous programming through language features and APIs that use Future and Stream objects.
